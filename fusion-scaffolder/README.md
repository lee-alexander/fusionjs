# Template

The template from which a project is scaffolded MUST have a `content/` folder and an `index.js` file at the root. The `content/` folder will hold the template files that will be used in a newly scaffolded project. The `index.js` file will be called prior to scaffolding in order to gather required context/values to be passed to files that are compiled via nunjucks. Any `.njk` file in the `content/` folder will be compiled with nunjucks, using values obtained via the scaffold CLI as well as the implementation of `index.js`, and the `.njk` extension will be removed upon scaffolding.
